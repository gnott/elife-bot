  # Lens image naming:
  #   Main figures: e.g. Figure 7 of article 04232 is named elife04232f007.jpg
  #                 (see http://lens.elifesciences.org/04232/#figures)
  #
  #   Supplementary figures are named sequentially by suppplementary figcount,
  #   and are not related to their 'main' figure by filename.
  #   For example:
  #   Figure 2 supplement 2 in http://lens.elifesciences.org/08069/#figures
  #   is named elife08069fs003.jpg because it is the third figure supplement
  #   in that article.
